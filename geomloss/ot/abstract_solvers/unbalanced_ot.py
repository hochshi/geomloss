    r"""Returns the required information (cost, etc.) from a set of dual potentials.

    Args:
        eps (float): Target (i.e. final) temperature.
        rho (float or None (:math:`+\infty`)): Strength of the marginal constraints.

        a ((..., N) Tensor, nonnegative): Weights for the "source" measure on the points :math:`x_i`.
        b ((..., M) Tensor, nonnegative): Weights for the "target" measure on the points :math:`y_j`.
        f_aa ((..., N) Tensor)): Dual potential for the "a <-> a" problem.
        g_bb ((..., M) Tensor)): Dual potential for the "b <-> b" problem.
        g_ab ((..., M) Tensor)): Dual potential supported by :math:`y_j` for the "a <-> b" problem.
        f_ba ((..., N) Tensor)): Dual potential supported by :math:`x_i`  for the "a <-> a" problem.
        batch (bool, optional): Are we working in batch mode? Defaults to False.
        debias (bool, optional): Are we working with the "debiased" or the "raw" Sinkhorn divergence?
            Defaults to True.
        potentials (bool, optional): Shall we return the dual vectors instead of the cost value?
            Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        Tensor or pair of Tensors: if `potentials` is True, we return a pair
            of (..., N), (..., M) Tensors that encode the optimal dual vectors,
            respectively supported by :math:`x_i` and :math:`y_j`.
            Otherwise, we return a (,) or (B,) Tensor of values for the Sinkhorn divergence.
